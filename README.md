# ♻️ ReCoil — Waste Not, Earn a Lot.  

ReCoil is a sustainable web based application developed as part of **Garuda Hacks 6.0**, designed to address the problem of used oil waste in households and businesses. We empower people to **turn their used cooking or motor oil into money**, while contributing to a more sustainable and circular economy.

## 🌟 Overview

Every drop of waste oil has value. With ReCoil, we make sure it's not wasted. Our platform connects two main user roles **Members** and **Agents**, to facilitate the exchange of used oil and oil-based products through a transparent and user-friendly system.

ReCoil isn't just a website. It's a **community** and **educational platform**, encouraging eco-conscious behavior, informed trade, and community-led interaction.
